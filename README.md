# Mobile-Accounting-App-Design
Project Overview
+ This mobile application is designed to help users manage their daily finances. The app allows users to track income and expenses, generate visual financial reports, and receive personalized financial advice. The goal is to provide an easy-to-use platform to help users better understand their cash flow and improve financial management skills.

Core Features
+ Income Management:
Users can manually enter income details, including salary, investment returns, and rental income. The app will generate pie charts showing the percentage of different income sources.

+ Expense Management:
Users can import bank statements or payment records from major apps. The app will automatically categorize expenses into categories such as food, housing, transportation, and entertainment. It will also calculate monthly total expenses and highlight the largest spending categories.

+ Budget Analysis:
Based on user income and expenses, the app will show monthly savings or debts and offer suggestions for financial improvement, including recommended spending ratios for categories like food, housing, and entertainment.

+ Chart Visualization:
The app will create various visual charts to help users easily understand their financial data. For example, pie charts to show income breakdown and bar charts to display expense distribution.

+ Financial Health Analysis:
The app will analyze spending patterns and identify the largest spending category each month. It will also show the user’s overall savings or debt status, providing practical financial advice on how to improve financial health.

+ Extended Features (Currently Beyond My Skill Level)
Automatic Import of Bank Statements and Payment App Data:
The app will integrate with APIs from banks and payment platforms (like PayPal, Venmo, Alipay, etc.) to automatically import and record expense data. (I am familiar with calling APIs but still need to explore the underlying principles in more depth.)

+ Personalized Financial Advice:
The app will leverage AI to offer personalized financial advice based on the user’s income and spending habits. This may include tips on reducing overspending or exploring investment opportunities.

+ Multi-Device Sync:
Users can seamlessly sync their data across different devices, such as phones, tablets, and computers, ensuring a smooth experience across platforms.

+ User Scenarios
Daily Financial Management:
Users who want to track their daily finances can manually enter income and expenses, generate charts, and get a clear picture of where their money is going.

+ Personal Finance Optimization:
For users aiming to improve their financial health, the app provides helpful budgeting tips and financial advice to optimize spending and savings.

Managing Multiple Income Sources:
Users with diverse income streams (e.g., investors, freelancers, or landlords) can use the app to manage the percentage and growth of each income source.
